# 7 Updates

Future updates recognised for the webpage is as follow:

- adding update/edit CRUD functionality for the users comments.

This will enable the user to edit their comments. Currently users can only create, read and delete.

- Authentication

Currently we are using cookies as the authentication tokens. This is an insecure method of authenticating users. An immediate update would require a using flask login which has been installed ready for the update.
